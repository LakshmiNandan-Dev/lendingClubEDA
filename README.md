## General Information
You work for a consumer finance company which specializes in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:

If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

This case study is limited to data exploratory analysis. So no further action required to impute nulls or build and train model for prediction

In this case study, We will use EDA to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default.

## Conclusions
We have observed  that the  annual_income is positively correlated to loan_amount.  If the customer has more annual income they are opting high amount of loan. 
Total_acc is also positively correlated to Annual_income. 

More customers are opted loan for their debit consolidation, i.e, to repay other loans . the  customers who paid their loan fully and most number of defaulted customers are also from debt_consolidation purpose only.
